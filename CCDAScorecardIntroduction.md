#### Background
The C-CDA Scorecard leverages the work completed by an ONC-funded grant â€” [SMART (Substitutable Medical Apps Reusable Technologies)](https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/substitutable-medical-apps-reusable-technologies) and promotes best practices in C-CDA implementation by assessing key aspects of the structured data found in individual documents. It is a tool designed to allow implementers to gain insight and information regarding industry best practice and usage overall. It also provides a rough quantitative assessment and highlights areas of improvement which can be made today to move the needle forward. The [best practices and quantitative scoring criteria](http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/wg/structure/C-CDA%20Scorecard%20Rubrics%203.pptx) have been developed by HL7 through the HL7-ONC Cooperative agreement to improve the implementation of health care standards. We hope that providers and health IT developers will use the tool to identify and resolve issues of C-CDA document interoperability in their health IT systems.
